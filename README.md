# Free Retro Blog

A blog template for game developers, inspired by John Carmack's .plan files, where you can share your
coding journey without web dev skills. It's hosted for free on GitHub Pages with no dependencies,
just simple HTML and markdown for ease of use. Visit my ongoing blog at [nerdypunk.github.io](https://nerdypunk.github.io)
